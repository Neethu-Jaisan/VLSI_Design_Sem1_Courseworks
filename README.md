# VLSI Design – Semester 1 Courseworks

This repository contains the coursework, lab work, and mini-projects completed during **Semester 1 of my M.Tech in VLSI Design**.

The work focuses on hands-on implementation of digital and analog VLSI concepts, semiconductor device modeling, and CAD-based design approaches, with an emphasis on simulation, verification, and analysis.

## 📘 Subjects Covered
- CMOS Digital IC Design  
- Analog VLSI Circuits  
- Digital Systems and Circuits  
- Semiconductor Device Modeling  
- CAD for VLSI  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Verilog HDL  
- SPICE  
- TCAD  
- C Programming (for CAD applications)  
- Simulation & waveform analysis  

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder corresponds to a specific subject and includes:
- Design / code files  
- Simulation results and waveforms  
- A README describing the objective, approach, and learnings  

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Writing synthesizable RTL and testbenches  
- FSM-based digital design and verification  
- Analog circuit analysis through SPICE simulations  
- Device-level understanding using TCAD tools  
- Applying C programming concepts to CAD-related problems  

This repository will be updated with refinements and additional documentation as I continue learning.
