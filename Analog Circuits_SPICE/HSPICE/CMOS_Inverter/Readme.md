## Tools Used
- HSPICE

## Analyses Performed
- DC Transfer Characteristics
- Transient Response
- Average Power Consumption

## Key Observations
- Proper switching behavior observed around mid-supply voltage
- Symmetric rise and fall times achieved by sizing PMOS wider than NMOS
- Low static power dissipation

## Applications
